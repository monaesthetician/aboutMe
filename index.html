    <h2>A little bit about me</h2></div>
    

    <p>I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand in 1977. I obtained a bachelor's degree in Communication Arts, specializing in advertising, and have 13 years of experience in 
        the marketing field.  I started my first adventure in 2014 for ESOL programs in London. I worked there for a couple of years before calling Cincinnati my home in 2017.
        My current job since moving to the US is working as an assistant manager for a restaurant. This position has taught me plenty of customer service skills. 
        However, technology has always been my side passion. I first started my tech journey by joining a basic full-stack program on Udemy and I enjoyed my first course so much that 
        I decided to enroll in an accredited boot camp at Kable Academy to pursue my passion. Now I know this will be my lifelong career.
